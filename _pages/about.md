<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hey, I'm a second year Ph.D. student at [Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://tasl.ucr.edu/), University of California, Riverside. It is my honor to be advised by Prof. [Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). 

My research interest lies in the confluence of autonomous agents and multiagent systems, focusing on leveraging efficient multi-agent communication to develop robust algorithms for collaboratively solving perception, prediction, and decision-making challenges in real-world scenarios.

Previously, I earned my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the New York University in 2023, where I was also interested on assessing the robustness of LLMs, with a particular interest in identifying and generating adversarial prompts that could mislead the models and even generate harmful content.

# üî• Research Interests

- BEV Perception, Cooperative Perception, Occupancy Prediction
- Trajectory Prediction and Planning
- Multi-Agent Social Navigation
- Trustworthy LLM/VLM (misinformation, hallucination, out of domain)

# üìù Recent Projects

- [CMP: Cooperative Motion Prediction with Multi-Agent Communication](https://cmp-cooperative-prediction.github.io/)
  - A practical, latency-robust framework for cooperative motion prediction, which leverages the information shared by multiple CAVs to enhance perception and motion prediction performance.
  - Address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules.
  - Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real to demonstrate the effectiveness.

- Auto-generation of jailbreaking prompts by combining token-based learning and sampling strategy.

  - Despite advancements in safety alignment, Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks using specifically designed prompts. Current state-of-the-art prompt optimization [techniques](https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks), focusing on token-wise loss, often result in easily detectable prompts by perplexity-based defenses. This study investigates generating effective and semantically meaningful adversarial prompts by sampling from successful hand-crafted examples while remaining different levels of similarity, aiming to preserve their efficacy while enhancing meaningfulness.
